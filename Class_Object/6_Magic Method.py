"""
all built in method surrounding by double underscore is called magic or dunder method
example: __init__ method
There are lot of magic methods--------we dont need to use all of them...but should have understanding...
Why this magic method---methods are being invoked internally to perform some action like __add__ method
this __add__ method is invoked when we use + operator to add some numerics

a=5, b=10, so a+b=10..this is not so easy as we can see here........here __add__ method is responsible to this addition actoin
